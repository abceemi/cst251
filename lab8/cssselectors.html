			<h2>Problems</h2>
			 <h3 class="probelm">Problem number 1</h3>
			<p>The firts problem was figuring our how to proparly use a div.
				Once i understood that theyre used as a visual seperation between sections.
				I felt more confident in knowing where to apply them.</p>
			 <h3 class="probelm">Problem number 2</h3>
			<p>The second problem was struggling with placement.
				It took me longer than I hoped to find out how to place everything so it would be centered.
				After a couple ofgoogle searches and one youtube video I started to understand how to do it.
