	<h2>Challanges</h2>
	<p>Lexi and I both struggled to get our links to work.
    We later realized that our error came from having spaces as well as forgetting to include an equal sign after href.
     I ran into an issue when my third link was not working. I later found out that it was my internet not refreshing the page.
     It was the most stressful moment because I knew I had gotten the other links to work.
     Thankfully I didn't give up and eventually it refreshed.
</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
  <p>All links now work.</p>
