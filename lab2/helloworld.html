    <p>Aimee and Lexi are both Communication Design majors with visual emphasis.
       This is our first class together. We are looking forward to learning how to code.
       Lexi is working at the University and Aimee is currently not working due to COVID restrictions.
        We both have had Wes as a professor before. He is really cool.</p>
