		<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
		<p>At first I couldn't figure out why my image would not appear next to my link. My thought process was to first link the website in the portion that says "< a href=" and then link the image from the website under the img portion. With lexy's help i was able to understand that the first portion includes the link and the second part is an image you choose from your local server. which then works as a link. After feeling successful I then struggled to add a link that would redirect back to th e main page. </p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>I was able to succesfully link websites to images.</p>
