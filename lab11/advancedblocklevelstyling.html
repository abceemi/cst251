		About me: My name is Aimee Castellon. My social security number and  my mothers maiden name are..... hahah just kidding.
		I'm 25 years old. I have a husky mixed with a german shephard who doesnt appreciate my love and affection. She only likes me for the snacks.
		I transfered from hartnell last year. Some hobbies of mine include but are not limited to: sleeping, doing assignments at 2am. doodeling on my tablet
		and watching netflix. I'm currentlt watching a show called "ratched" I personally think its good. Just a little gruesome.
		My goal in life is to be happy and unbothered.
